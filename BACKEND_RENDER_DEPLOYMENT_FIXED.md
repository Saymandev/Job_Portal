# Backend Render Deployment - Fixed Configuration

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

1. **Monorepo Build Issue**: Render was trying to build both frontend and backend due to Turbo configuration
2. **Frontend ESLint Errors**: Unescaped apostrophe causing build failure
3. **Root Directory**: Added proper root directory configuration

## üîß Configuration Changes

### 1. Updated `apps/backend/render.yaml`
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: job-portal-backend
    env: node
    plan: starter
    rootDir: apps/backend  # ‚Üê Added this line
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npm run start:prod
```

### 2. Created `apps/backend/.renderignore`
```
# Ignore frontend files to prevent build issues
../frontend
../../apps/frontend
node_modules
.git
*.log
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.development
```

### 3. Updated `apps/backend/package.json`
- Fixed lint script to only check backend files
- Made it completely independent from monorepo

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. In Render Dashboard
1. Go to your service settings
2. Update the **Root Directory** to: `apps/backend`
3. Keep build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Keep start command: `npm run start:prod`

### 2. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Render:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret_key
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

### 3. Deploy
- Click "Save" in Render
- The service will automatically redeploy
- Check the build logs to ensure only backend is being built

## ‚úÖ Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Root Directory**: `rootDir: apps/backend` tells Render to only work in the backend directory
2. **Independent Package.json**: Backend now has its own package.json that doesn't reference Turbo
3. **Render Ignore**: Prevents frontend files from being processed
4. **Fixed ESLint**: All frontend ESLint errors are now resolved

## üîç Verification

After deployment, check:
- Build logs show only backend compilation
- No frontend build errors
- Service starts successfully
- Health check endpoint works: `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health`

## üö® Important Notes

- Make sure to set the **Root Directory** in Render dashboard to `apps/backend`
- The frontend should be deployed separately to Vercel
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` in Render with your actual Vercel URL after frontend deployment

Your backend should now deploy successfully! üéâ
